### Decentralized AI to Ocean marketplace DAOhaus boost

A boost for AI/ML DAOs to provide the ability to publish assets such as data sets and AI models to oceans market place and earn royalities for the DAO members.


## Problem
The world produces large amounts of data. Organising, analysing and producing value and insights from this data has traditionally been performed by big tech companies who have the resources (data, talent & capital). The main benefactors of this value creation are a few key members of the company rather than the team that worked on the project. Centralisation of data science value creation in the hands of a few companies leads to stagnation of innovation and a lack of experimentation due to bureaucracy and a risk aversive culture.


## Solution

Algovera is a collective of diverse people working to facilitate and accelerate the development of decentralised AI products that benefit society. We do this through empowering diverse AI teams with tools to work for themselves on their own ideas and keep ownership of their creations. Algovera Decentralized AI DAO framework can be described in three layers: (i) Web3 Commercialisation Models & Funding, (ii) Community, and (iii) Infrastructure (tools/libraries/integrations).

### (i) Commercialisation: A boost to integrate DAOhaus with Oceans market place.
Algovera is providing tools for datasets and AI models to publish from a DAO to marketplaces such as Oceans Market place and receive royalities. This will enable AI teams to receive renumerations based on usage of their model.**

**Funding** for independent AI teams: Algovera is a community of diverse and independent AI teams (called Squads). These teams are funded through the Algovera Micro-Grants Program. Proposals are submitted on Discourse. We set up a DAO for each of these teams (currently using DAOhaus). You can check out our full list of Squads and links to the respective DAOs here. We support and train our squads in web3 governing, treasury and revenue models through the DAO and Web3 sustainability/growth model monetization of data sets and AI models.

### (ii) Decentralized Ethical AI community events: 
We run study groups, discord community, reading groups, discussions, hacking sessions, hackathons, design thinking groups and IRL events.

### (iii) Infrastructure for decentralized AI: 
We want to make it as easy as possible for individuals to get from idea to deployed AI app. To achieve this, we are integrating many different technologies such as decentralized storage, compute, marketplaces and integrating environments such as JupyterLab with MetaMask.

## Ask
Could you advice us on what DAOhaus functionality and how we could develop a boost?


## Help

We would like to invite any and all community members who are interested in contributing to join our Design Thinking sessions and/reach out to us on discord.

Current tasks in the pipeline include:
    Advice on boost functionality spec
    Solidity contributions, code review, or audits of the boost codebase
