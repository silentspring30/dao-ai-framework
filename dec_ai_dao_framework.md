# Decentralized AI DAO Framework
For the development of a Decentralized AI DAO framework, we conducted a user review of the how squads are currently using DAOhaus.
It formed the basis of continuous research, development, prototyping and assumptions testing for a decentralized AI DAO framework.

For the development of a Decentralized AI DAO framework, I'd like to propose to follow a [Design Thinking Framework](https://web.stanford.edu/~mshanks/MichaelShanks/files/509554.pdf).

## Development Approach
Design Thinking is a framework for complex problem solving and has been widely applied by various disciplines e.g. Digital Product, Healthcare and Social innovation. As a methodology it has been popularized by [Tim Brown](https://designthinking.ideo.com/), founder of IDEO since 1978.
 
Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that cross-disciplinary teams use to firstly understand users and their context to address ill-defined or unknown problems. It is  particularly useful in developing products and services with a high factor of uncertainty and within a dynamic and rapidly evolving environment such as web3 specificly: for the development of a Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Framework for Decentralized Artificial Intelligence.

Design Thinking involves five phases — Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test—it ([Design Thinking Phases](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking))
1. **Empathy** or discovery, where the goal is to empathize with the audience for who you are designing with/for, 
2. **Define** or interpretation, which involves describing the point of view and needs of the individual, 
3. **Ideate** or ideation, that includes brainstorming to produce as many creative solutions as possible,
4. **Prototype** or experimentation, where several solutions are developed with users to be able to manipulate and identify flaws,
5. **Test** or evolution, which includes sharing the prototype with the target users to obtain observations, feedback and to further iterate.

Design thinking allows for bidirectional movement, this flexible process fosters iterative exploration of solutions, continual refinement of the problem space, and increased understanding of user's latent needs. 

Diversity, cross-disciplinary collaboration, challenging viewpoints and varied socioeconomic backgrounds in teams are highly valued and allow to develop creative solutions that are beneficial to society at large. 

I'd like to propose an extension to the Design Thinking process by adding the following assumption testing "lenses" to Decentralized AI models and the development of the DAO:

DAO development 
- **Community**, where the goal is to understand who is represented in this DAO and is it actively seeking to integrate diversity in it's community events? 
- **Ethics**, this includes if various backgrounds (socioeconomic, gender, race and data rich/poor) have been considered in the creation and continous onboarding of this DAO? E.g. reaching out to specific members of society.
- **Plant-based Living**, what is the environmental impact of this DAO and are DAO members actively creating awarness around plant-based living?
- **Commercial**, who is this DAO model renumerating and is it supporting the progress of decentralized AI and communities?

If the community of the DAO is build in this way, then these values should be reflected in the development of the AI model development.

AI Model
- **Community**, where the goal is to understand which communities the AI model is impacting? 
- **Ethics**, this includes if various backgrounds (socioeconomic, gender, race and data rich/poor) have been considered in the creation of this data or model, what bias exist and is it harmful? Can it be deployed? Should it be disabled?
- **Plant-based Living**, what is the environmental impact of this data and model? Could it be reduced?
- **Commercial**, who is this model renumerating and is it supporting the progress of decentralized AI and communities?

# Ethics

AI model:
Data Sets

# Bias: Historical, Aggregation, Measurement, Evaluation, Deployment and Representation
# Fairness: Demographic parity / statistical parity, Equal accuracy, Group unaware / "Fairness through unawareness"

# Model Cards










## About Algovera DAO

[Algovera](https://www.algovera.ai/) is a collective of diverse people working to facilitate and accelerate the development of decentralised AI products that benefit society. We do this through empowering diverse AI teams with tools to work for themselves on their own ideas and keep ownership of their creations. Algovera can be described in three layers: (i) Community, (ii) Infrastructure (tools/libraries/integrations), and (iii) Funding & ownership.

**Decentralized Ethical AI community events:** We run [study groups](https://docs.algovera.ai/blog/2022/05/09/Algovera%20Private%20AI%20Study%20Group), discord community (LINK), reading groups, [discussions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwf3muttuqQ&t=1699s), [hacking sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AThhcQrjRQk&list=PLgIrgqrkZC93qCxZFx_kWzk2vFdvgJjJI), [hackathons](https://mirror.xyz/0x8b2622EEA6ca1cD84423a63DD551bAC913BAc932/Lk1S-PD3eEfxttwYFrD4yOZNmidZJzMY1kQpYEewv7Q), diverse design thinking groups (LINK) and IRL events.

**Infrastructure for decentralized AI:** We want to make it as easy as possible for individuals to get from idea to deployed AI app. To achieve this, we are integrating many different technologies such as decentralized [storage](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/517), compute, [marketplaces](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/algovera-a-decentralized-hub-for-data-scientists-in-web3-round-17/1828) and integrating environments such as [JupyterLab with MetaMask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjBYOxeHzG4).

**Funding for independent AI teams:** Algovera is a community of diverse and independent AI teams (called Squads). These teams are funded through the Algovera Micro-Grants [Program](https://docs.algovera.ai/blog/2021/12/23/Introducing%20Algovera%20AI%20x%20Web3%20Grants). Proposals are submitted on [Discourse](https://forum.algovera.ai/). We set up a DAO for each of these teams (currently using DAOhaus). You can check out our full list of Squads and links to the respective DAOs [here](https://algovera.notion.site/Squads-194768658a044302a0cdc24d5d758b9d). We support and train our squads in web3 governing, treasury and revenue models through the DAO and Web3 sustainability/growth model monetization of data sets and AI models.


## About DAOhaus
DAOhaus is a community first, no-code DAO platfrom that allows to create DAOs within minutes. It is based on MolochDAO's Open source code version 2.1.
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a community of people aligned by a common goal where decision making power is distributed and resources are collectively managed. 

### MolochDAOs framework is:
1. Simplicity, less code is more secure
2. Treasury
3. Members protection such as ragequit and guildkick
4. Proposal process
5. Differentiation of non-transferable shares (voting power) and loot (monetary value but no voting power)
6. Component driven: Minions and boosts

[Moloch DAO version 3] (https://medium.com/pubdao/dao-framework-builder-moloch-launches-v3-at-ethdenver-1f3841c45a9e) will bring new features such as the ability to make changes through proposals in settings e.g. voting period.
