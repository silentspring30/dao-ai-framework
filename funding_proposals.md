### Decentralized AI Boost on top of DAOhaus

A Decentralized AI boost for DAOhaus to integrate assets such as data sets and AI models to oceans market place.


## Problem
The world produces large amounts of data. Organising, analysing and producing value and insights from this data has traditionally been performed by big tech companies who have the resources (data, talent & capital). The main benefactors of this value creation are a few key members of the company rather than the team that worked on the project. Centralisation of data science value creation in the hands of a few companies leads to stagnation of innovation and a lack of experimentation due to bureaucracy and a risk aversive culture.


## Solution

# Commercialisation: A boost to integrate DAOhaus with Oceans market place.

Algovera is a collective of diverse people working to facilitate and accelerate the development of decentralised AI products that benefit society. We do this through empowering diverse AI teams with tools to work for themselves on their own ideas and keep ownership of their creations. Algovera can be described in three layers: (i) Community, (ii) Infrastructure (tools/libraries/integrations), and (iii) Funding & commercialisation.

Decentralized Ethical AI community events: We run study groups, discord community, reading groups, discussions, hacking sessions, hackathons, design thinking groups and IRL events.

Infrastructure for decentralized AI: We want to make it as easy as possible for individuals to get from idea to deployed AI app. To achieve this, we are integrating many different technologies such as decentralized storage, compute, marketplaces and integrating environments such as JupyterLab with MetaMask.

Funding for independent AI teams: Algovera is a community of diverse and independent AI teams (called Squads). These teams are funded through the Algovera Micro-Grants Program. Proposals are submitted on Discourse. We set up a DAO for each of these teams (currently using DAOhaus). You can check out our full list of Squads and links to the respective DAOs here. All of our code is open source.

Commercialisation: Algovera is providing tools for datasets and AI models to publish from the DAO to marketplaces such as Oceans Market place and receive royalities. This will enable AI teams to receive renumerations based on usage of their model.



## Overview

## Product

## Ask

8,500 DAI & your help

## Funds

Algovera boost has taken 0 funding to date. Time has been giving on a volunteer basis.

Funds will be used for:
    Boost specification and MVP - Silentspring
     contracts - 
    Compensation to additional MetaCartel & RaidGuild volunteer contributors (TBA)

None of this grant will be retained by the core team members. It will be spent immediately to get the product closer to shipping.

## Help

We would like to invite any and all community members who are interested in contributing to reach out in the comments below or on discord 2. meTokens needs to be a community owned protocol and we are happy to reward community members with governance tokens and additional funding in exchange for contributions. Current tasks in the pipeline include:

    Integrating 3Box 2, Ceramic 1, theGraph (and building a subgraph)
    Solidity contributions, code review, or audits of the meTokens-core codebase
    UX Design to review or contribute to the figma boards and meTokens-interface codebase

Furthermore, in the event this proposal is passed and meTokens opens a Community Contribution Offering, MetaCartel members will be included in the whitelist of contributors.
