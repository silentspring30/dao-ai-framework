## Problem



## Solution


## Overview
## Product

    Create your own meToken
    Invest in others’ meTokens
    Spend your portfolio of meTokens with their issuers on goods and services
    Redeem your meTokens for their underlying collateral
    Know that everything is economically secure

## Progress


While technically functional, the alpha revealed a significant number of opportunities for improvements, including:

    Vault-AMM partitioning - coincidentally, an innovation also converged upon simultaneously in Balancer V2’s upcoming release
    Dynamic bonding curves - a new AMM primitive which dramatically expands upon Billy Rennekamp’s original proposal from 2018
    Governance & liquidity mining - meTokens was originally designed to avoid governance at all costs in favor of pure self-sovereignty. However, since Apr 2020, enough experiments have taken place throughout DeFi to recognize the increased efficiency and coordination that can take place when a governance token is incentivized and distributed correctly without compromising user security

Each of these innovations has been rolled into a completely new version of meTokens, which is currently in the final stages of development, along with a brand new, more content rich, social dapp platform. All of which will be made open source upon release.
Differentiation

meTokens are critically different from any other personal token design because their supply and distribution is managed entirely by a custom built AMM, not a centralized issuer. The AMM ensures that all meTokens are properly collateralized with real underlying value, and that this value is predictably skewed in favor of a single address recipient - the “owner” of the meToken.



## Ask

8,500 DAI & your help

## Funds

Boost has taken 0 funding to date. Time has been donated by silentspring.

The requested funds will serve as a bridge to launch the new, ready-for-prime-time version of meTokens. Expenses include:

    Design and branding - proposal from Raid Guild members Lucas, Bingo, & Tom
    Governance, airdrop, & liquidity mining contracts - proposal by Crypto_Unico 1
    Compensation to additional MetaCartel & RaidGuild volunteer contributors (TBA)

None of this grant will be retained by the core team members. It will be spent immediately to get the product closer to shipping.

## Help

We would like to invite any and all community members who are interested in contributing to reach out in the comments below or on discord 2. meTokens needs to be a community owned protocol and we are happy to reward community members with governance tokens and additional funding in exchange for contributions. Current tasks in the pipeline include:

    Integrating 3Box 2, Ceramic 1, theGraph (and building a subgraph)
    Solidity contributions, code review, or audits of the meTokens-core codebase
    UX Design to review or contribute to the figma boards and meTokens-interface codebase

Furthermore, in the event this proposal is passed and meTokens opens a Community Contribution Offering, MetaCartel members will be included in the whitelist of contributors.
